# Progress: Seamless BP

## 1. What Works (Current State)
- **Project Setup**: Basic Next.js project structure exists (`app` directory with subfolders).
- **Landing Page**: An initial landing page (`app/page.tsx`) is present.
- **Authentication**: Basic Supabase Google OAuth flow initiated. (Currently has issues, needs debugging/improvement).
- **Dashboard Structure**: A basic dashboard layout (`app/dashboard/page.tsx` likely) exists post-login.
- **Navigation**: A basic navbar component exists, allowing navigation between sections (though target pages might be placeholders).

## 2. What's Left to Build (Immediate Focus / Next Steps)
1.  **Fix Authentication**: Debug and stabilize the Supabase Google OAuth login process.
2.  **Dashboard Data**: Fetch and display a list of projects on the main dashboard.
3.  **Implement Project Detail View**: Create the page/components to show details for a selected project.
4.  **Build Out Finances Section**: Design schema, implement UI for viewing invoice status.
5.  **Build Out Timecards Section**: Design schema, implement UI for viewing logged hours.
6.  **Settings Page**: Implement user settings functionality.
7.  **Database Schema**: Define and implement Supabase tables for `projects`, `finances`/`invoices`, `timecards`, and potentially `users`/`profiles`.

## 3. Current Status
- **Phase**: Early Development / Foundation Building.
- **Focus**: Stabilizing core authentication and building out the initial dashboard view.

## 4. Known Issues / Blockers
- **Google Authentication**: The existing Google OAuth flow via Supabase is reported as having issues and needs debugging.
- **Missing Data/Schema**: Core data models (projects, finances, timecards) are not yet implemented in Supabase.
- **Placeholder Pages**: Sections like Finances, Timecards, and Project Details likely exist as placeholder pages/routes without full functionality.
