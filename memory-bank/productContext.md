# Product Context: Seamless BP

## 1. Problem Solved
Seamless BP aims to resolve communication bottlenecks and lack of centralized information access at DeHyl Constructors. Currently, project managers and clients rely on fragmented communication (emails, calls) to exchange updates on project status, financials, and timelines. This leads to inefficiencies, potential misunderstandings, and difficulty for both parties in maintaining a clear, up-to-date overview of project progress and financial health.

## 2. How it Works (User Experience Vision)
- **Login**: Managers and Clients log in easily using their Google accounts.
- **Dashboard Overview**: Upon login, users see a central dashboard providing a consolidated view of all relevant projects.
- **Project Drill-Down**: Users can navigate (likely via a sidebar/navbar) to view detailed information for a specific project.
- **Financial Clarity**: A dedicated section will show financial details, focusing on invoice status (e.g., issued, paid, overdue).
- **Time Tracking Visibility**: Another section will provide insights into labor hours logged against projects.
- **Role-Specific Views**: While core information is shared, views might be subtly tailored (e.g., managers might see more administrative options).

## 3. User Experience Goals
- **Centralization**: Provide a single source of truth for project status, finances, and time tracking.
- **Efficiency**: Reduce time spent by managers on manual updates and by clients seeking basic information.
- **Transparency**: Offer clients clear visibility into project progress and financial standing.
- **Simplicity & Intuitiveness**: Ensure the interface is easy to navigate and understand for both technical and non-technical users.
- **Reliability**: Ensure core features like authentication and data display are dependable.
